13) Write a Python program to find items starting with a specific character from a list.
Expected Output:
Original list:
['abcd', 'abc', 'bcd', 'bkie', 'cder', 'cdsw', 'sdfsd', 'dagfa', 'acjd']
Items start with a from the said list:
['abcd', 'abc', 'acjd']
Items start with d from the said list:
['dagfa']
Items start with w from the said list:
[]

14) Write a Python program to flatten a given nested list structure.
Original list: [0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]
Flatten list:
[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]

15) Write a Python program to split a given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is given.
Original list:
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]
Length of the first part of the list: 3
Splited the said list into two parts:
([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])

16) Write a Python program to split a given list into specified-sized chunks.
Original list:
[12, 45, 23, 67, 78, 90, 45, 32, 100, 76, 38, 62, 73, 29, 83]
Split the said list into equal size 3
[[12, 45, 23], [67, 78, 90], [45, 32, 100], [76, 38, 62], [73, 29, 83]]
Split the said list into equal size 4
[[12, 45, 23, 67], [78, 90, 45, 32], [100, 76, 38, 62], [73, 29, 83]]
Split the said list into equal size 5
[[12, 45, 23, 67, 78], [90, 45, 32, 100, 76], [38, 62, 73, 29, 83]]

17) Write a Python program to join two given list of lists of the same length, element wise.
Original lists:
[[10, 20], [30, 40], [50, 60], [30, 20, 80]]
[[61], [12, 14, 15], [12, 13, 19, 20], [12]]
Join the said two lists element wise:
[[10, 20, 61], [30, 40, 12, 14, 15], [50, 60, 12, 13, 19, 20], [30, 20, 80, 12]]
Original lists:
[['a', 'b'], ['b', 'c', 'd'], ['e', 'f']]
[['p', 'q'], ['p', 's', 't'], ['u', 'v', 'w']]
Join the said two lists element wise:
[['a', 'b', 'p', 'q'], ['b', 'c', 'd', 'p', 's', 't'], ['e', 'f', 'u', 'v', 'w']]

18) Given a list of numbers. write a program to turn every item of a list into its square.

19) Concatenate two lists in the following order : 
list1 = ["Hello ", "take "]
list2 = ["Dear", "Sir"]

['Hello Dear', 'Hello Sir', 'take Dear', 'take Sir']
